## You're Back â€“ My World Is Whole Again  

The moment I saw you step back into my life on the morning of 15th November, it felt like the sun had risen just for me. These days without you were like a stormy seaâ€”restless, endless, and longing for calm. But now that you're here, my love, everything feels right again.  

Having you back fills the space in my heart that was aching in your absence. Your smile, your voice, the warmth of your presenceâ€”itâ€™s everything Iâ€™ve been yearning for. As I hold you close now, Iâ€™m reminded of how lucky I am to call you mine. No distance, no time apart, and no challenge can ever dim the love I feel for you.  

You, my dearest, are my home. And now that youâ€™re here, my heart is full, and my soul is at peace. I love you endlessly and canâ€™t wait to create more memories with you, hold you tighter, and love you deeper with every passing moment. ðŸ’•
